# Model Tools

# ❓ What is Model Tools
Model Tools is a simple script to help automate the compilation and decompilation of Panda3D's Model Files.

This app is really useful for people to view models without the full SDK.

This app comes bundled with bam2egg.exe, egg2bam.exe and the correct DLLs as well as a noob proof batch script for little to no confusion.

# 🖍 Usage

## 💻 Windows
To use this tool simply run the **model-tool.bat** file after moving your BAM or EGG files into the project.

## 🐧 Linux
TBA
